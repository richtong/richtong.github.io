While many may not make the connection, eating healthy not only tastes great and
improves your health, but also has important impacts on farming. More natural
foods are farmed in a different way than conventional foods. Instead of
pesticides, fertilizers and chemicals, farmers use natural processes like crop
rotation to improve the quality of their crops. This seminar will cover the
impacts of different natural foods on farming and therefore the planet.

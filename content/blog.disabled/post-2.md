As wage rates have not kept up with housing prices, more and more people cannot
afford the basics of life. This seminar covers the causes and issues that have
made the problem so much worse over the last few years. We also cover potentials
solutions that can be used by governments, civic groups and community leaders to
solved these problems.

This is an introductory seminar that we will follow up with additional materials
to solve these problems. Stay tuned!

  Over the last ten years, I've accumulated all kinds of tools and things and we are making this available to the world.
  There are two major ones, [Bin](/bin) and [Lib](/lib) which has all the library functions. We use this as a form
  of documentation. Everytime something gets installed, it is documented in an installation script.

      Our Mission: Have Fun Working with Great People to Change the World for the Better
    subtitle: >
      Yes it's a big goal, but for the last 40 years, we've all had an amazing time doing it.
      From the early days of minicomputers (yes, DEC PDP-8!) to the PC then on to the mobile, cloud,
      and now the AI revolutions. What an adventure from nearly every place in the world. From North America
      to Asia to Europe. With more fun to come.
